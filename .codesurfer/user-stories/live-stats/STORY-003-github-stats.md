# Live GitHub Statistics Integration

**Story ID**: STORY-003
**Epic**: Live Stats
**Priority**: High
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-15T08:19:30Z
**Assigned by**: Wave Navigator (Master Coordinator)

## User Story

**As a** visitor assessing Hamdi's GitHub activity
**I want** to see real-time statistics and contributions
**So that** I can evaluate his ongoing development work and commitment

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Real-time Stats Display
**Given** I am viewing the stats section
**When** the page loads
**Then** I should see live GitHub statistics including:
- Total commits (current year)
- Pull requests created
- Issues opened/resolved
- Contribution streak/calendar
- Repository count

### AC2: Animated Data Visualization
**Given** the stats are loading
**When** the data fetches from GitHub API
**Then** I should see smooth counting animations
**And** progress bars should animate to final values
**And** loading states should be visually appealing

### AC3: GitHub API Integration
**Given** the profile is deployed
**When** GitHub API data is available
**Then** statistics should update automatically
**And** API errors should be handled gracefully
**And** fallback values should display during outages

### AC4: Contribution Calendar
**Given** I want to see activity patterns
**When** I view the contribution section
**Then** I should see a GitHub-style activity calendar
**And** recent activity should be highlighted
**And** hover interactions should show daily details
