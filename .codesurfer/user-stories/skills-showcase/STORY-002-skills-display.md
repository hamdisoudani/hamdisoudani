## User Story

**As a** technical recruiter or fellow developer
**I want** to see Hamdi's comprehensive technology skills organized by category
**So that** I can quickly assess his technical breadth and expertise

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Categorized Skills Display
**Given** I am viewing the skills section
**When** the page loads
**Then** I should see skills organized in logical categories:
- Frontend: ReactJS, NextJS, VueJS
- Backend: NestJS, Node.js, Express, Python, Java, Go, C/C++/C#
- Mobile: Flutter, Swift, React Native
- AI/ML: LangChain, LangGraph, Mastra.ai, CopilotKit.ai
- DevOps: Docker, CI/CD, Infrastructure

### AC2: Visual Badges Implementation
**Given** I am viewing each skill category
**When** I scan the section
**Then** each technology should display as a visual badge/icon
**And** badges should have consistent styling and sizing
**And** badges should show technology names clearly

### AC3: Interactive Skill Details
**Given** I want to learn more about a specific skill
**When** I hover over a technology badge
**Then** I should see a subtle animation or tooltip effect
**And** the interaction should be smooth and responsive

### AC4: Skills Section Layout
**Given** I am viewing on different screen sizes
**When** the page resizes
**Then** skills should reflow responsively
**And** categories should maintain visual hierarchy
**And** no horizontal scrolling should be required
